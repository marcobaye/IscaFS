                                07 Jul 2005


This is release 0.17 of IscaFS. If you did not download this archive from
    http://home.pages.de/~mac_bacon/smorbrod/IscaFS/
or
    http://splodge.fluff.org/~phil/
just now, then I suggest you check whether there's a newer version
available.

more details.


What it is:
    IscaFS is an image filing system allowing read-only access to ext2/ext3
file systems. In addition to floppy discs and image files, it also handles
hard disc partitions (so if you have ARMLinux, you can access the files on
your ext2/ext3 partitions).


Supported OS versions:
    RISC OS < 3.5:
        You will either need a copy of Justin Fletcher's dynamic areas
        support module (called "DDA" or "Dummy") or you will have to
        re-assemble IscaFS after configuring it to use the RMA instead of a
        dynamic area. See the file !IscaFS.Docs.Build on how to do this.
    RISC OS 3.5 or higher:
        IscaFS should work without problems.
        It's 32bit-clean, so it should run on Iyonix as well. If not, tell
        me.


Where the docs are:
    The complete documentation is contained in the !IscaFS.Docs directory.
Open the Filer's menu over the !IscaFS icon and choose the "Help" menu entry
to open the directory containing the documentation. Start by reading the
file !IscaFS.Docs.!ReadMe

    !IscaFS
         The actual application containing the image filing system module.
    !ReadMeNow
        *This* file.
    Source

Changes from release 0.16, 07 Sep 2004
          to release 0.17, 07 Jul 2005:

    Fixed a bug concerning top-bit-set addresses, mainly surfacing on RO5.
        This resulted in empty filer windows. Thanks to Chris Terran for
        finding the cause of this bug.
    Adjusted module version number used in the !Run file (had been wrong the
        last few releases).
    Fixed a bug concerning comma-separated file type information.


Changes from release 0.14, 08 May 2004
          to release 0.16, 07 Sep 2004:

    Fixed a bug in the two-level cache system. Now that it finally works as
    intended, performance improved radically (up to 300%).
    File type sprite now looks a bit like a directory.


Changes from release 0.13, 23 Apr 2004
          to release 0.14, 08 May 2004:

    Just bug fixes:

    Fixed bug in two-level cache usage (cache A wasn't used at all).
    Fixed bug which could result in stale cache entries being used. This
        only surfaced when dismounting volumes (for example floppy discs).
        Thanks to Rien Mertens for reporting that bug.
    Fixed time/date conversion code. No longer off by 0.76 seconds.


    For a full list of changes see the file !IscaFS.Docs.ChangeLog


I think that's all for now.
Have fun.
