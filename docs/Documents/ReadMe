				IscaFS - ReadMe
				~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			Version 0.06, 28th October, 1998


PLEASE read ALL of this file.  It won't take you long, and it'll be worth it
(probably).

Only one thing has changed since 0.05, a fix in s.Cache where the block-from-
inode function was grabbing bad blocks from files of over 64meg in length
(the triply-indirected blocks).  Thanks to Timothy Baldwin for pointing this
one out.

I no longer think I'll be implementing any of the plans I had for IscaFS,
since I've decided to steer away from developing for RiscOS in favour of
unix-based systems.  I will probably still do small bug fixes to IscaFS, but
I'm now intending to dedicate my spare time to learning perl and
investigating compression techniques.

If anyone else should wish to develop IscaFS further, please talk to me
first.  This is STUPENDOUSLY important if you intend to implement any write
operations, since using the current cacheing system with write operations
will break.

P.S. As usual, any bug reports or comments are appreciated.
