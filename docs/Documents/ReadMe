				IscaFS - ReadMe
				~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			Version 0.08, 10th April 1999


PLEASE read ALL of this file.  It won't take you long, and it'll be worth it (probably).

The major changes since 0.06 are the new cache system (warning: dodgy, not well-tested code, please report any bugs to forrey@eh.org), and Nicholas Clark's patch which allows partitions over 4gig to be accessed.

I don't think I'll be implementing a write capability in IscaFS, since the amount of time required to do this almost certainly outweighs the use it'd be.  Instead, I'll be hacking away at my own filing system, OhFFS, which is much more fun (ie horrendously complicated - I don't yet have nightmares about implementing write capability, but I'm sure I will).

Although I'm not going to be actively developing IscaFS, I'll still be available for fixing bugs.

If anyone has a burning desire to take over development of IscaFS, they're welcome.  Please contact me for your Free Development Pack (TM)!
