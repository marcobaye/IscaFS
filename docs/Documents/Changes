				IscaFS - Changes
				~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			Version 0.08, 10th April 1999


This file is a brief description of the main changes that have taken place
between this version and the last release version.  For a full list of
changes see the 'ChangeLog' file.

WARNING!  IscaFS has a new cache system, which was added in 0.07, and isn't particularly well tested.  Please send any bug reports to me (forrey@eh.org) and I'll try to fix them.  It should be a lot faster than the old cache system, but Chris Rutter's been mentioning that it's actually slower - I think I have a bug :-(.

The other recent addition is far more reliable.  Nicholas Clark's modified IscaFS so it can now read partitions of over 4gig in size, and also made some StrongARM optimisations while he was there.
