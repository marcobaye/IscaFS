This file is a brief description of the main changes that have taken place
between this version and the last release version.  For a full list of
changes see the 'ChangeLog' file.

The only change in this version is the fixing of a bug pointed out by Timothy
Baldwin (thanks) which caused the later blocks in files of over 64meg (in 1k
block filesystems) to completely screw up.  Basically, the wrong block number
was being found in part of the block getting process.
