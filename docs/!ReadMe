	!ReadMe for IscaFS 0.05
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please read this file before using IscaFS - it's rather important.

Firstly, I should stress that you don't need any compilers or assemblers other than what's supplied with this distribution and what's included in your computer's ROM (ie BASIC).

If you have RiscOS 3.5 or higher, or Justin Fletcher's dynamic areas support module, you should recompile !IscaFS after changing 'config_dynamicareas%' to 1 in the '!IscaFS.b.Config' file.  This will not only mean your RMA gets less fragmented, but IscaFS also uses a faster memory manager (about 100 times faster than the one used in the RMA).

The 'Support' directory contains the following:

GetPartns	a little program which will create pseudo-images so you can
		access your ext2 partition(s) with IscaFS.

ReadPart	a little program which allows you to dump entire ext2 partitions
		into ext2 image files.  It only works for the ADFS
		'partitioning' system though.

!PCFNLib	an assembly library which IscaFS requires for its compilation.

!PNAsm		a preassembler used to compiler IscaFS with.

The 'Documents' directory contains all the documentation relevant to IscaFS.  Please read the 'ReadMe', 'Bugs' and 'Changes' files in that directory.

To recompile IscaFS, simply double-click on the file !IscaFS.Makefile.  As long as PNAsm and PCFNLib have been seen (do ensure that if you already have these, the new ones supplied with this release of IscaFS are the ones which will be used) it should assemble correctly first time.

IscaFS is currently configured and compiled with rather a lot of first and second-level cache.  If you are using a low-memory machine and wish to change this, change the relevant values in the '!IscaFS.b.Config' file and recompile IscaFS.

Well, that's about it.  I hope you find IscaFS useful.  Enjoy!

Phil
