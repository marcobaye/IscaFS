This program would not have been possible without the help of quite a few
people.  Thankyou to everyone who helped in any way.

Special thanks to Matthew Wilcox for the enormous amount of time he's spent
helping me with ext2fs and other linuxy things.  I really appreciate it;
IscaFS certainly wouldn't be around if it weren't for him.

Thanks to Chris Rutter, who told me to write it.

Thanks also to Matthew Godbolt for his marvellous MemoryAllocator module
(used for the dynamic area memory allocation in IscaFS).

Thanks also to Russell King for not only pointing out some nasty bugs, but
also for porting the OS itself :-).

Thanks to Dickon Hood who came up with a cunning hacky filing system idea
which is now implemented in the form of LinuFS.

Thanks to Timothy Baldwin who pointed out a horrible bug which caused bad
block numbers to be used in files over 64meg in length (ie the triply
indirected blocks).

Thanks to Nicholas Clark, who fixed IscaFS so it can now read partitions greater than 4gig in length, and made some StrongARM optimisations too.

MB> Thanks to Frank de Bruijn, who significantly helped in putting together release 0.12plus.
