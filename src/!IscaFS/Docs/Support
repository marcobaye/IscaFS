This file explains what the helper programs in the "Support" directory do.


GetPartns
~~~~~~~~~
Version 0.01, 07th January, 1998

Introduction
------------
The "GetPartns" program is designed to read the linux partition table on the given disc and create pseudo image files for each linux ext2 partition found.

Usage
-----
Set the directory in which the "GetPartns" program lives as the current directory.  Ensure it is on a read-write filing system, since GetPartns will save the image files into the current directory.  Now type...

getpartns <filing system> <drive number>

... where <filing system> is the RiscOS filing system on which the partitions reside, and <drive number> is the drive on which the partitions reside.  For example...

getpartns adfs 4

... would read my hda drive, finding the only partition on there (hda3) and creating a pseudo image from that.  The filing system name doesn't need to be in any specific case.

When you've created your pseudo images, simply double-click on them (ensuring IscaFS has been seen by the Filer) and you should then be able to access the relevant partition.


lsattr-isc
~~~~~~~~~~
This is a small and simple command line program written in BASIC. When started via "lsattr-isc" (it does not support any parameters), the contents of the currently selected directory are displayed in a UNIXy kind of way.

Example output of my ARMLinux root directory:

    Type tAccess___ RISC_OS_ Name
    0100 drwxr-xr-x 00-r-0WR lost+found
    0100 drwxr-xr-x 00-r-0WR bin
    0100 drwxrwsr-x 00-r-0WR boot
    0100 drwxr-xr-x 00-r-0WR dev
    0100 drwxr-xr-x 00-r-0WR etc
    0100 drwxr-xr-x 00-r-0WR floppy
    0100 drwxrwsr-x 00-r-0WR home
    0100 drwxr-xr-x 00-r-0WR lib
    0100 drwxr-xr-x 00-r-0WR mnt
    0100 drwxr-xr-x 00-r-0WR root
    0100 drwxr-xr-x 00-r-0WR sbin
    0100 drwxrwxrwt 00wr-0WR tmp
    0100 drwxr-xr-x 00-r-0WR usr
    0100 drwxr-xr-x 00-r-0WR var
    0100 drwxr-xr-x 00-r-0WR proc
    1010 lrwxrwxrwx 00-r-0WR vmlinuz
    1000 -rw------- 00---0WR /journal

Using this program only makes sense inside an ext2/ext3 volume, because IscaFS is the only filing system which supplies the necessary mode bits information. You can run this program in other filing systems as well, but it will give useless output.
If you find this program useful, copy it to your library directory. If you don't know what it is for, don't bother about it. ;)
(Tech info - this is how it works: Only the lower eight bits of the file attributes are commonly defined by RISC OS, the upper 24 bits are filing system dependent. Therefore, IscaFS 0.12 simply maps the 16 UNIX mode bits into the upper 16 bits of the RISC OS file attributes, where lsattr-isc can read them.)


ReadPart
~~~~~~~~
18th November, 1997
A little program which allows you to dump entire ext2 partitions into ext2 image files.  It only works for the ADFS 'partitioning' system though.
The program is somewhat unfinished - you will have to edit it before you can use it, because some parameters (partition number, output file name etc.) are hardcoded inside it.
