				~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			   Version 0.11, 16 Mar 2004


This file is a brief description of the main changes that have taken place
between this version and the last release version.  For a full list of
changes see the 'ChangeLog' file.


New in 0.11:

 * Can *really* access partitions larger than 4GB, and mounting them does no
   longer take ages.
 * Can handle all three block sizes (1024, 2048 and 4096 bytes).
 * Can handle ext2's "sparse_super" and "filetype" features.
 * Several small bits and pieces (see ChangeLog)

Nope, still no write support. :)


Older changes (from 0.06 to 0.08):

WARNING!  IscaFS has a new cache system, which was added in 0.07, and isn't particularly well tested.  Please send any bug reports to me (forrey@eh.org) and I'll try to fix them.  It should be a lot faster than the old cache system, but Chris Rutter's been mentioning that it's actually slower - I think I have a bug :-(.

The other recent addition is far more reliable.  Nicholas Clark's modified IscaFS so it can now read partitions of over 4gig in size, and also made some StrongARM optimisations while he was there.
