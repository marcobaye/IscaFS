MB> These are release notes for older versions I didn't want to delete.


Changes from release 0.12plus to release 0.13, 23 Apr 2004:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Fixed "The Last Bug", which prevented RO5/Iyonix compatibility.
    Thanks to Daniel Ellis for finding it and helping to fix it.
Added "PartTool" program as an alternative to "GetPartns" and "ReadPart".


Changes from release 0.12 to release 0.12plus, 18 Apr 2004
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Replaced MAlloc module with 32bit-clean version.


Changes from release 0.11 to release 0.12, 16 Apr 2004
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Fixed a bug which could freeze the machine when scanning empty dirs.
Added MimeMap calls so IscaFS now copes with ".ext" type extensions as
    well (in addition to ",hex" extensions). It's a bit slower though.
Spaces in filenames are now converted to ALT-Spaces.
Improved handling of "," in filenames. Older versions truncated at first
    comma, new version truncates at comma if exactly 3 chars follow.
32bit-cleaned the module (though I don't have an Iyonix. If you want to
    give me one as a present, go ahead).
Added "lsattr-isc" program to display UNIX file mode bits.
Correctly recognizes UNIX pipes, character devices, block devices and
    sockets and refuses to load them. Better conversion of UNIX access
    mode bits to RISC OS attributes (but read access is always granted).
Updated documentation.
Changed ordering in ChangeLog file.
Corrected usage of "i_blocks%" (now renamed to i_512bblocks%), which gives
    the allocated size in traditional UNIX blocks (512 byte), not the FS's
    logical blocks.
"!Run" file now tries to load correct version of MAlloc module (26-bit or
    32-bit).
Added "RMEnsure MimeMap" to "!Run" file.
Tampered with Phil's library to include 32bit-clean versions of the macros
    used. Changed the source to use the new macros.


Changes from release 0.08 to release 0.11, 16 Mar 2004
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
IscaFS now finally copes with all three block sizes and the standard ext2 filesystem features ("sparse_super" and "filetype"). In short, IscaFS is now able to access all current ext2/ext3 partitions. In addition to that, some bugs were fixed and some simple entry points added. See "Changes" and "ChangeLog" for details.


Changes from release 0.06 to release 0.08
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The major changes since 0.06 are the new cache system (warning: dodgy, not well-tested code, please report any bugs to forrey@eh.org), and Nicholas Clark's patch which allows partitions over 4gig to be accessed.

I don't think I'll be implementing a write capability in IscaFS, since the amount of time required to do this almost certainly outweighs the use it'd be.  Instead, I'll be hacking away at my own filing system, OhFFS, which is much more fun (ie horrendously complicated - I don't yet have nightmares about implementing write capability, but I'm sure I will).

Although I'm not going to be actively developing IscaFS, I'll still be available for fixing bugs.

If anyone has a burning desire to take over development of IscaFS, they're welcome.  Please contact me for your Free Development Pack (TM)!

Phil
