				IscaFS - GetPartns
				~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			Version 0.01, 07th January, 1998


Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This program is designed to read the linux partition table on the given disc and create pseudo image files for each linux ext2 partition found.



Usage
~~~~~
Set the directory in which the GetPartns program lives as the current directory.  Ensure it is on a read-write filing system, since GetPartns will save the image files into the current directory.  Now type...

getpartns <filing system> <drive number>

... where <filing system> is the RiscOS filing system on which the partitions reside, and <drive number> is the drive on which the partitions reside.  For example...

getpartns adfs 4

... would read my hda drive, finding the only partition on there (hda3) and creating a pseudo image from that.  The filing system name doesn't need to be in any specific case.

When you've created your pseudo images, simply double-click on them (ensuring IscaFS is loaded first) and you should then be able to access the relevant partition.
