* !IscaFS

This is the IscaFS application directory, but without the module.

* iscafs

This contains the source code to build the IscaFS module.

* !PNAsm

This is Phil Norman's assembler used to assemble the IscaFS module.

* !PCFNLib

This application holds Phil Norman's library files needed for assembling.

* GetPartns

This is a little C program which will create pseudo-images so you can access
your ext2 partition(s) with IscaFS.  You need a C compiler if you want to
change this program.

* ReadPart

This is a little program written in BBC BASIC which allows you to dump
entire ext2 partitions into ext2 image files.  It only works for the ADFS
'partitioning' system though.
