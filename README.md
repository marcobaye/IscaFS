# IscaFS

IscaFS is an ext2 image filing system for RISC OS.

---

IscaFS allows read-only access to files inside ext2/ext3 image files and hard
disc partitions. It is released under the GNU GPL.

The software was originally written by Phil Norman, his home page can be
found [here](http://splodge.fluff.org/~phil/risc-os/).

This repository is my attempt to collect all updates to this software in a
central place, i.e. I tried to re-create the source code history from the
zip files that were separately released back in the day.

## System requirements

* IscaFS is for ARM-powered computers running RISC OS.

* IscaFS needs RISC OS 3 or higher to run.

* Early versions are not 32-bit clean.

## Building from source

Everything you need to re-build the software can be found in this
repository, except for a computer running RISC OS.
